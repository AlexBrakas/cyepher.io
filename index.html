      About Me
    </h1>
    <p class="paragraph">
      I am a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/cyepher">Streamer</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/Cyepher">YouTuber</a>, and Coder. <br> <br>
      I spend most of my time nowadays studying at university to become a astrophysisct, so sadly I don't get to create as much content as I would hope to.
      Instead I spend my free time thinking bigger, creating bigger and better projects day in and day out to hopefully show people it's not as hard as it may seem
      to reach the potenial you want to.
